# Installation

Welcome to Brokn, the exciting new application that moves fast...
_and breaks!_ This topic describes how to install Brokn.

## Prerequisites

- Computer with:
  -- At least 1 TB of available RAM
  -- An 8-core processor
  -- A quantum coprocessor with 16 qbits in full superposition
- Windows 10 or later
- Eye of newt
- Toe of frog
- Wool of bat
- Tongue of dog

## Procedure

1. Make sure the computer is plugged in and turned on. 
2. Download the Brokn repo at https://github.com/breakrco/brokn.
3. Send out for pizza.
4. Open PowerShell.
5. Run the command: `heyinstallalready.sh` 

## Troubleshooting

**The quantum coprocessor loses superposition**

Check your cryogenic system for leaks.

**The heyinstallalready script throws an "I dunno" error**

This common problem is caused by an undetermined error state. Consider:
1. A life in farming
2. Rewriting the script so that it works
3. Taking your frustrations out on our competitors. Their address is: 
   1313 Mockingbird Lane
   Mockingbird Heights, CA 94530

**I feel like I am trapped in a soulless system of exploitation and despair**

We can offer no practical solution, but we feel your pain.
